django-project-template
=======================

This repository is intended to be used as an init template for new Django project.

The template(s) are aimed towards [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/).


## Quick start

There are a few dependencies that will be installed and any virtual environment
isn't taken into consideration. Make sure an environment is active before the
following command is executed, if such a setup is intended.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-shack/django-project-template/v1.0.0/init.sh)
```

Running the command in a terminal will setup a new Django project and provide
templates for Django applications and deploying an app with _Docker_ and _Ansible_
on a dedicated machine.
